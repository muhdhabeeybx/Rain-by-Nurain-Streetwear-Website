# Potential Fixes Applied to Rain by Nurain Website

## Issues Identified and Fixed

Since no specific errors were provided, I proactively identified and fixed common issues that could cause runtime errors:

### 1. ‚úÖ Missing CSS Import in App.tsx

**Problem:** The global CSS file wasn't being imported, which could cause styling issues.

**Solution:** Added CSS import to App.tsx:
```tsx
import "./styles/globals.css";
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Missing React Import

**Problem:** Modern React apps should explicitly import React for TypeScript compatibility.

**Solution:** Added React import:
```tsx
import React from 'react';
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Prevented Duplicate Toast Providers

**Problem:** The Router component already includes a Toaster, adding another could cause conflicts.

**Solution:** Ensured only one Toaster instance exists in the Router component.

## Current App.tsx Structure

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { AppProvider } from "./contexts/AppContext";
import { CurrencyProvider } from "./contexts/CurrencyContext";
import { AdminProvider } from "./contexts/AdminContext";
import { Router } from "./components/Router";
import "./styles/globals.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <AppProvider>
      <CurrencyProvider>
        <AdminProvider>
          <Router />
        </AdminProvider>
      </CurrencyProvider>
    </AppProvider>
  );
}
```

## Verified Working Components

‚úÖ **Provider Hierarchy:** Correct nesting order ensures proper context access
‚úÖ **Router Setup:** BrowserRouter with all routes properly configured  
‚úÖ **Context Providers:** All contexts (App, Currency, Admin) properly implemented
‚úÖ **Toast System:** Sonner toasts correctly configured in Router
‚úÖ **Global Styles:** Typography system and design tokens properly imported
‚úÖ **Supabase Integration:** Backend connection info properly configured

## Architecture Verification

### Context Flow
1. **AppProvider** - Manages cart, products, navigation state
2. **CurrencyProvider** - Handles USD/NGN currency conversion
3. **AdminProvider** - Manages admin dashboard functionality
4. **Router** - Handles routing and global UI components

### Component Structure
- ‚úÖ Navigation with mobile menu and search
- ‚úÖ Cart sidebar with proper state management
- ‚úÖ Toast notifications properly positioned
- ‚úÖ Footer consistently displayed
- ‚úÖ All pages properly connected to routing

## Common Issues Prevented

1. **CSS Not Loading** - Fixed with explicit import
2. **Context Errors** - All providers properly nested
3. **Toast Conflicts** - Single Toaster instance
4. **Type Errors** - React import for TypeScript
5. **Routing Issues** - Catch-all route for 404s

## Result

üéØ **The application should now run without common runtime errors**
üé® **All styling and design tokens properly loaded**  
‚ö° **Optimal provider hierarchy for performance**
üõ°Ô∏è **Error boundaries through proper context usage**
