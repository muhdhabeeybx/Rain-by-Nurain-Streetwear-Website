# Admin Context Import Fixes Applied

## Overview
Fixed critical import errors and mobile admin navigation positioning for the RBN e-commerce admin dashboard.

## Primary Issues Resolved

### 1. AdminContext Import Errors ✅
**Problem**: All components were importing from `/contexts/AdminContext.tsx` which didn't exist.
**Solution**: Updated all import statements to reference the correct `/contexts/AdminContextFixed.tsx`.

#### Files Updated:
- `/App.tsx` - Fixed AdminProvider import
- `/components/admin/ProductModal.tsx` - Fixed useAdmin and types import
- `/components/admin/PromotionModal.tsx` - Fixed useAdmin and AdminPromotion import
- `/components/admin/OrderDetailsModal.tsx` - Fixed useAdmin and AdminOrder import
- `/components/admin/CustomerDetailsModal.tsx` - Fixed useAdmin and AdminCustomer import
- `/components/admin/ResponsiveTable.tsx` - Fixed admin types import
- `/contexts/AppContext.tsx` - Fixed useAdmin import
- `/pages/AdminPage.tsx` - Fixed useAdmin import

### 2. Mobile Admin Navigation Positioning ✅
**Problem**: Mobile admin tab navigation was potentially overlapping content and needed professional positioning.
**Solution**: Applied proper sticky positioning and content spacing.

#### Improvements Made:
- Added `sticky top-16 z-30` to MobileTabNav for proper positioning below header
- Updated AdminPage container with `admin-mobile-content` class for proper spacing
- Enhanced CSS with mobile-specific spacing rules
- Optimized tab padding from `py-4` to `py-3` and gap from `gap-2` to `gap-1.5` for compact professional look

### 3. CSS Enhancements ✅
**Added mobile-specific styles**:
```css
@media (max-width: 1023px) {
  .admin-mobile-content {
    padding-top: 8px;
    min-height: calc(100vh - 148px); /* Header (64px) + mobile tab nav (60px) + padding */
  }
}
```
