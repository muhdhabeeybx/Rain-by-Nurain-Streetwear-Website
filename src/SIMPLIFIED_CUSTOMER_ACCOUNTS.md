# Simplified Customer Account System

## Overview
Implemented a streamlined, user-friendly customer account system that uses **email-only access** without passwords or verification codes. Accounts are automatically created from checkout data.

## ✅ **How It Works**

### **1. Account Creation (Automatic)**
- **No registration required**: Accounts are automatically created when customers place orders
- **Data from checkout**: Customer name, email, and phone are captured during checkout
- **Zero friction**: No additional steps for customers

### **2. Account Access (Email-Only)**
- **Simple email input**: Customer enters their email address on `/account` page
- **Instant access**: If orders exist for that email, account dashboard is shown immediately
- **No passwords**: No verification codes, no complex authentication
- **Session-based**: Stays logged in during browser session only

### **3. Account Data (From Orders)**
- **Real order history**: Shows all orders placed with that email address
- **Customer profile**: Built automatically from order data (name, email, phone)
- **Account statistics**: Total orders, total spent, member since date
- **Order tracking**: Full order details and tracking information

## 🎯 **User Experience Flow**

### **First-Time Customer**
1. Places order with email `customer@example.com`
2. Account is automatically created using order data
3. Can access account anytime using just their email

### **Returning Customer**
1. Visits `/account` page
2. Enters email address
3. **Instantly sees** their order history and account details
4. Can track orders, view details, and manage account

### **No Account Yet**
1. Enters email that hasn't placed orders
2. Gets friendly message: "No account found, place an order first"
3. Can continue shopping and account will be created automatically
